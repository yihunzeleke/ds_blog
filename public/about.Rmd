I am Yihun Zeleke. I am basically from Ethiopia, I got my Bsc Degree in Applied Statistics from Jimma university in 2010 and I also have Masters degree in Public Health from Bahir Dar University in 2017. I have worked for the government of Ethiopia in Central Statistical Agency as Statistician, Data Manager, Cspro Programmer, and Data Analytics for more than 7 years. 

I moved to USA in May 2018, I have worked for WESTAT here in USA as Cspro programmer consultant. I decieded to change my career to Data Science, so I was getting training for the advancement of my career in Machine Learning and Data Science for the last one and half year. 

I don't have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every  Data Science project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
